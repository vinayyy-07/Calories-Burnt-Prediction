**Project Title:** Predicting Calories Burned During Exercise

**Objective:**  
The project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned based on various exercise-related parameters such as age, gender, duration, and heart rate.

**Steps Taken:**  

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**  
   - **Datasets:**  
     - Two datasets were used: `exercise.csv`, which contains user exercise details, and `calories.csv`, which provides the corresponding calories burned.  
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
     - Checked for missing values and gained insights using descriptive statistics and visualizations (e.g., count plots for gender and distribution plots for age and weight).  
     - Created a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between variables.  
   - **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**  
     - Merged the datasets into a single DataFrame using `pandas.concat()`.  
     - Encoded the categorical variable "Gender" (male as 0, female as 1) for machine learning compatibility.  

2. **Feature Selection:**  
   - Dropped irrelevant columns such as `User_ID` and the target variable `Calories`.  
   - The input features (`X`) and target (`Y`) were separated for model training.

3. **Model Development:**  
   - **Algorithm Used:**  
     - Employed the **XGBoost Regressor (XGBRegressor)**, a gradient-boosting algorithm optimized for performance and speed.  
   - **Data Splitting:**  
     - Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`.  
   - **Training:**  
     - Wrapped the model training (`model.fit`) in a custom function to ensure modularity and handle compatibility issues.  
   - **Prediction:**  
     - Predicted calorie burn for the test dataset.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Calculated the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to measure model accuracy. The MAE indicates how close the predicted values are to the actual values.

**Visualizations:**  
- Count plots to analyze gender distribution in the dataset.  
- Distribution plots for continuous variables like age and weight.  
- Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Developed a robust model to predict calories burned with good accuracy.  
- Enhanced understanding of working with real-world datasets, data preprocessing, and feature engineering.  
- Gained hands-on experience with XGBoost, visualization techniques, and model evaluation.
